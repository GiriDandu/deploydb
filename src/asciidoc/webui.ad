= #DeployDB Web UI Design

Below is a rough outline of what a few of the key DeployDB web-based views
should entail.


== Developer View

*Goal:* Provide quick feedback to the status of a particularly versioned
Artifact as it progress through its deployment pipeline

In this view the user should be presented with a horizontal layout of the
different Environments that the requested Artifact must progress through.

Referencing the above mockup, the Artifact (`verspaetung-0.2.1+0c3d.jar`) is in
the current state:

* It has been deployed to the "ephemeral-alpha" Environment
** The Promotions: "healthchecks", "readonly-smoke-tests" and
   "mutable-smoke-tests" have passed.
* It has been deployed to the "integration" Environment
** The Promotions: "healthchecks" and "readonly-smoke-tests" have passed
** The Promotions: "mutable-smoke-tests" have failed
* The Artifact has not _yet_ been deployed to the "production" Environment


== Manager View


*Goal:* Provide an overview of which Services, composed of which Artifacts, are
deployed into the available Environments

In the above mockup, there are three Environments that are available with
various Services contained within them. Inside of each of those Services there
are multiple Artifacts that make them up.

This view is giving a manager, QA or non-technical user an overview of which
versions of which Artifacts can be found in which Environments. In this case
the "Versp√§tung" service has a _newer_ version of the
`com.github.lookout:verspaetung` Artifact in "ephemeral-alpha" than the
"integration", and "integration" has a newer version than "production."

The `cookbooks:deploydb-cookbook`Artifact in the "ephemeral-alpha" Environment
is also of a newer version than "integration" and its Promotions have failed,
resulting in the Artifact's progression through the Environments (left to
right) to stop.
