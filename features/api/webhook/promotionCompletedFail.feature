  @freezetime @webhook
  Scenario: Webhooks should be invoked when promotion is completed in failed state
    Given a promotion webhook "completed" configuration:
    """
      promotion:
        completed:
          - http://localhost:10000/job/notify-promotion-completed/build
    """
    And there is a deployment in "COMPLETED" state
    When I POST to "/api/deployments/1/promotions" with:

        "status" : "FAILED",
        "infoUrl" : "http://local.lookout.com/jenkins/job-id/2/results"
      }
    """
    Then the webhook should be invoked with the JSON:
    """
      {
        "id" : 1,
        "artifact" : {
          "id" : 1,
